- Test as you go

**2. Replace placeholders**
- [YOUR-EMAIL] → your actual email

**3. Keep backups**
- Save current content before replacing

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

**"The styling looks different on my site"**
- Your site's CSS might override these styles
- Copy just the content (not the `<style>` tags)
- Or adjust styles to match your theme

**"Schema markup isn't showing in Google"**
- Can take 1-4 weeks to appear
- Test at: search.google.com/test/rich-results
- Make sure you replaced all [PLACEHOLDERS]

**"Images aren't showing"**
- Replace emoji placeholders with real images
- Use proper image URLs
- Add alt text for SEO

**"Layout is broken"**
- Make sure you copied the complete section
- Check for missing closing tags
- Use HTML validator: validator.w3.org
