    <h1>Three Goats Saved My Family</h1>
    <p class="hero-subtitle">This is the story of how darkness, healing, and three charming goats created something extraordinary.</p>
</div>

<!-- STORY #1: THE ORIGIN -->
<div class="container">
    <div class="story-section highlighted">
        <h2>🐐 The Beginning: 2009</h2>
        
        <p>In 2009, my family was falling apart.</p>
        
        <p>Someone we loved was seriously ill. The kind of sick where you don't know if they're going to make it. Where every day feels impossible.</p>
        
        <p>And in the middle of all that darkness, three goats showed up at our farm.</p>
        
        <p>I know that sounds random. But those three goats... they gave us something to care about when everything else felt hopeless.</p>
        
        <p>We'd go out every morning. Feed them. Talk to them. They didn't judge. They didn't need anything complicated. They just... existed. And somehow that was enough.</p>
        
        <div class="goat-emoji">🐐 🐐 🐐</div>
        
        <p>Slowly, our family member started to heal. And those goats went from companions to milk producers.</p>
        
        <p>We started experimenting in the kitchen. Goat milk ice cream. Cheese. Lasagna. Every recipe felt like a celebration of getting our life back.</p>
        
        <p class="emotional-emphasis">Then someone noticed: our skin looked different. Healthier. We couldn't figure out why.</p>
        
        <p>Until we started researching goat milk.</p>
        
        <p>Turns out, what was healing us on the inside was also healing us on the outside.</p>
        
        <div class="quote-box">
            Same pH as human skin. Natural vitamins. Lactic acid for gentle renewal. Fatty acids that rebuild your skin barrier.
        </div>
        
        <p>We couldn't keep that to ourselves.</p>
        
        <p>So in 2017, we started Artisan The Goat. Not because we wanted to be a skincare company. <strong>Because we wanted to share what helped heal us.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Those three goats are still here. Retired now. Living their best life.</p>
        
        <p>And every jar we make, we make with the same intention: to bring healing to someone else's life, the way those goats brought healing to ours.</p>
        
        <p class="emotional-emphasis">This isn't just skincare. It's the reason we're still here.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 40px; font-size: 1.3em; color: #8b6f47;">That's the Artisan story. And if you choose us, you become part of it.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- STORY #2: THE SCIENCE -->
    <div class="story-section">
        <h2>🔬 Why Goat Milk Is Different</h2>
        
        <p style="font-size: 1.25em; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 40px;">Let me tell you why goat milk skincare is different from literally everything else you've tried. And I mean <em>everything.</em></p>
        
        <div class="science-points">
            <div class="science-point">
                <h3>First: pH Balance</h3>
                <p>Your skin's pH is about 5.5. Slightly acidic. That's your skin's protective barrier.</p>
                <p><strong>Most cleansers?</strong> pH of 9 or 10. Way too alkaline. They destroy your barrier every time you wash your face.</p>
                <p><strong>Most moisturizers?</strong> pH of 7 or 8. Still too high. Your skin has to work to rebalance itself.</p>
                <p><strong>Goat milk?</strong> pH of 5.5. Exact same as your skin.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 15px; color: #8b6f47; font-weight: 600;">Your skin doesn't have to fight it. It just... accepts it.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="science-point">
                <h3>Second: Natural Lactic Acid</h3>
                <p>Most products add synthetic AHAs for exfoliation. Which can irritate sensitive skin.</p>
                <p><strong>Goat milk?</strong> It IS lactic acid. Natural alpha-hydroxy acid that gently removes dead cells without the harshness.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="science-point">
                <h3>Third: Natural Vitamin A</h3>
                <p>Everyone wants retinol for anti-aging. But retinol is harsh. Drying. Irritating.</p>
                <p><strong>Goat milk contains retinyl palmitate.</strong> Natural vitamin A that promotes cell turnover without the side effects.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="science-point">
                <h3>Fourth: Fatty Acids That Rebuild</h3>
                <p>Your skin barrier is made of lipids. When it's damaged, you get dryness, sensitivity, breakouts.</p>
                <p><strong>Goat milk contains capric, caprylic, and caproic acids.</strong> Medium-chain fatty acids that literally rebuild your barrier.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="science-point">
                <h3>Fifth: Prebiotics for Your Microbiome</h3>
                <p>Your skin has a microbiome. Billions of beneficial bacteria that protect you.</p>
                <p><strong>Most products destroy it. Goat milk feeds it.</strong></p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="quote-box">
            This isn't marketing. This is biochemistry. Goat milk isn't just another ingredient. It's the ingredient your skin has been waiting for.
        </div>
        
        <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 40px; font-size: 1.2em;">Cleopatra knew it in 50 BC. Modern science proved it in 2025. Your skin will feel it the first time you use it.</p>
        
        <p class="emotional-emphasis">That's not a promise. That's chemistry.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- STORY #3: THE TRANSFORMATION -->
    <div class="story-section highlighted">
        <h2>✨ Real Transformation</h2>
        
        <p style="font-size: 1.2em; font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 30px;">"I tried everything. Nothing worked. Until this."</p>
        
        <p>For ten years, I had bad skin.</p>
        
        <p>Not just "oh, I broke out a little." I mean... bad. Painful cystic acne. Dry patches. Redness. Sensitivity to everything.</p>
        
        <p><strong>I tried everything.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Dermatologist prescriptions. Korean 10-step routines. French luxury brands. Clean beauty. Drugstore. High-end. <em>Everything.</em></p>
        
        <p>Nothing worked. Or it would work for two weeks and then stop. Or it would fix one problem and create three new ones.</p>
        
        <p>I spent thousands of dollars. Thousands. My bathroom looked like Sephora exploded.</p>
        
        <p>And my skin? Still terrible.</p>
        
        <p class="emotional-emphasis">I actually started to believe this was just... my face now. That I'd have bad skin forever.</p>
        
        <p>Then a friend said, "Try this."</p>
        
        <p>Goat milk moisturizer. One product. From a farm in Oregon.</p>
        
        <p>I laughed. "I've tried forty products. What's one more?"</p>
        
        <p>But I was desperate. So I tried it.</p>
        
        <div class="timeline">
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>First Night</h3>
                <p>It felt good going on. Absorbed fast. No greasiness. Okay, fine.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>First Week</h3>
                <p>My skin felt... calmer. Less reactive.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>First Month</h3>
                <p>I looked in the mirror and actually gasped.</p>
                <p>My skin was clear. Not perfect—but CLEAR. The redness was fading. The texture was smoothing out. The breakouts were gone.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>I stopped using everything else. Just goat milk moisturizer. Morning and night.</p>
        
        <p>It's been six months now.</p>
        
        <p><strong>People ask me what I did to my skin.</strong> They think I got treatments. Facials. Something expensive.</p>
        
        <div class="quote-box">
            I tell them: I stopped fighting my skin and started working with it. I found one thing with ingredients my skin actually recognizes.
        </div>
        
        <p>One thing that costs $25. One thing that finally, FINALLY worked.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 40px; font-size: 1.3em; color: #8b6f47;">If you've tried everything and nothing has worked... I get it. I was you.</p>
        
        <p class="emotional-emphasis">But maybe—just maybe—you haven't tried the one thing that will. What if this is it?</p>

        <h2>💙 What We Believe</h2>
        
        <p style="font-size: 1.2em; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 40px;">We've been offered a lot of money to sell this company. Big corporations. Private equity. People who could make us rich overnight.</p>
        
        <p class="emotional-emphasis">We said no. Every single time.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.15em;">Because this company isn't about money.</p>
        
        <h3 style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.5em; color: #8b6f47; margin: 40px 0 30px;">Let me tell you what we believe.</h3>

    <!-- STORY #5: THE INVITATION -->
    <div class="cta-section">
        <h2>Here's What Happens When You Join Us</h2>
        
        <p>Okay, so you're interested.</p>
        
        <p>You've heard the story. You understand the science. You've seen the transformations. You align with our values.</p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 1.4em; font-weight: 600; margin: 30px 0;">Now what?</p>
        
        <div style="background: rgba(255,255,255,0.1); padding: 40px; border-radius: 15px; margin: 40px 0; text-align: left;">
            <p><strong>First:</strong> You order. One jar. USDA Organic goat milk moisturizer. Made fresh in small batches on our farm in Oregon.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>We pack it with care.</strong> Not by robots in some warehouse. By us. By hand.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>It arrives at your door.</strong> You open it. It smells like... nothing. Because we don't add fragrance. Just pure ingredients.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>You try it that night.</strong> You'll notice: it absorbs fast. No grease. No film. Just soft skin.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Within three days,</strong> you'll feel a difference. Your skin will feel calmer. More balanced.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Within two weeks,</strong> you'll see a difference. Texture smoother. Tone more even. That glow people talk about? You'll have it.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Within a month,</strong> you'll be a believer.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 30px 0;">And here's where it gets good.</p>
        
        <p>You'll use less than you think. A little goes a long way. That $35 jar? Lasts six to eight weeks with twice-daily use.</p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 1.3em; font-weight: 600;">That's about a dollar a day. For skin that actually works.</p>
        
        <p>No ten-step routine. No cabinets full of products. Just one thing that does what it should.</p>
        
        <p>You'll notice you stop looking at other skincare. You found what works. Why keep searching?</p>
        
        <p><strong>You'll tell a friend.</strong> Not because we asked. Because you can't help it when something actually changes your skin.</p>
        
        <p>They'll try it. They'll love it. The community grows.</p>
        
        <div style="margin: 50px 0; padding: 30px; background: rgba(255,255,255,0.15); border-radius: 10px;">
            <p style="font-size: 1.3em;">And every time you buy, you're supporting a real family. Real goats. A real farm.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-top: 15px;">Not a corporation. Not shareholders. Us.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p style="font-size: 1.4em; margin: 40px 0 30px;">That's what happens when you join Artisan. You get great skin. We get to keep doing what we love. Everybody wins.</p>
        
        <h3 style="font-size: 2em; margin: 50px 0 30px;">So here's my question: Are you ready?</h3>
        
        <p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 40px;">Because we're ready for you.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 40px; font-size: 1.1em;">If it doesn't change your skin, we'll make it right.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 1.2em;">But I think you're about to find what thousands of others have found:</p>
